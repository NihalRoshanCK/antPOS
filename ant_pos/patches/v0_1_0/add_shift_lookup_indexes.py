"""Index the columns the shift-close and payments screens join on.

`Sales Invoice.custom_ant_opening` is a Custom Field and so has no index by
default, yet it is the sole predicate for both get_payments() and
AntClosingShift.get_pos_transactions(). `Payment Entry.reference_no` carries the
opening-shift name for the same reason. Without these, closing a shift scans
both tables in full.

The fixture now ships search_index=1 for custom_ant_opening; this patch covers
sites that already have the field, and adds the Payment Entry index that a
fixture cannot express (reference_no is a core ERPNext field).
